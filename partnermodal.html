            <h3 id="target1">Why bikes?</h3>
<p>Not only is cycling an incredibly efficient way to deliver things under a certain size within most urban and suburban areas, it’s also physically rewarding and fun! We’re no scientists, but we happen to know a guy named Bill Nye the Science Guy who is, and this is what he has to say: “There is no machine known that is more efficient than a human on a bicycle. A bowl of oatmeal, 30 miles, you can’t come close to that.” (http://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/why-i-bike). Bikes require no fossil fuels to run and far less fossil fuels to manufacture and maintain than automobiles. They also take up far less space on the road than automobiles, cutting down on traffic and parking problems. Sure, bikes cannot accomplish transporting everything required by the daily life of modern society, but you may be pleasantly surprised by how much a professional bicycle messenger from Hushpuppy Courier can do for you in a growing city like Gainesville.

          <h3 id="target2">How do you deliver my stuff undamaged and safely on a bike!?</h3>
<p>We have years of experience riding safely and efficiently in all weather and traffic conditions and have the right gear to deliver your stuff properly too. 75L waterproof messenger backpacks? We got ‘em. Front racks rated to hold up to 60lbs? Got those too. Insulated warming bags made to keep your food hot? Of course! And we never hit the road without a helmet, bell, lights, and flat-change kit. We’ll only take a job if we’re positive we can complete it to your total satisifcation, and if we think your delivery requires any extra packaging, we can advise you on how best to prepare it. Most things packaged to travel by car will also travel just fine by bike. That being said, we typically do not take any drink orders not in bottles or cans and may also turn down cupcakes or other especially fragile food orders depending on packaging and distance.

            <li>
<h3 id="target3">What if my pick-up and drop-off addresses are in different zones?</h3>
<p>We charge Outer Zone rates for any delivery with a pick-up address, a drop-off address, or both in the Outer Zone. Inner Zone rates only apply to deliveries with both the pick-up and the drop-off addresses within the Inner Zone.
          </p>

              <li>
   <h3 id="target4">What if my pick-up address and/or drop-off address is “on the border” between the Inner and Outer Zone?</h3>
<p>We will also generally charge an Inner Zone delivery fee for deliveries “on the border” between the Inner and Outer Zone. On UF campus, Hume, Jennings, and Beaty Towers residence halls are all considered Inner Zone addresses, while Diamond Village and Lakeside residence halls are all considered Outer Zone addresses. Depot Park is also considered Inner Zone.

                <li>

 <h3 id="target5">What if my pick-up address and/or drop-off address is outside of the Outer Zone?</h3>
<p>We might be able to work something out if you give us a call. We generally accept deliveries “on the border” (like a delivery going to Creekside Mall or picking up from Wal-Mart, for instance) and will generally charge an Outer Zone delivery fee. If we are confident we have the time, we may go even farther, although delivery outside of the Outer Zone is very dependent upon availability and will also cost more than an Outer Zone delivery.

                  </li>
          <li>
          <h3 id="target6">Will you front the cost of a purchase for me?</h3>
<p>We can, although for efficiency’s sake, we request and recommend that you prepay for any purchase from a restaurant or store yourself if at all possible. Many businesses take credit and debit card payments over the phone, and some even have web- and app-based payment options available. If prepayment of a purchase yourself is not an option, we request that you find out the cost of the purchase from the business, let us know, and we will charge you the cost of the purchase before picking it up and then charge you the delivery fee later upon timely completion of delivery. For shopping requests and other purchases for which exact purchase costs cannot be known prior to pick-up in-person, we can front the cost of any purchase estimated to be less than $100.

                  <li>
                    <h3 id="target7">How can I pay for a delivery?</h3>
<p>If you will be available at either the pick-up or drop-off of your delivery, we accept cash as well as credit and debit card payments via Square. You can also pay electronically via PayPal or Venmo. It is recommended that you prepay for any purchases being delivered, although we can front the cost of a purchase estimated to be less than $100 if necessary. If you will be at neither the pick-up nor the drop-off of your delivery, we can accept credit and debit card payment via Square over the phone, or you can pay electronically via PayPal or Venmo. We also offer invoicing every two weeks for regular clients.

                      <h3 id="target8">How do I become a regular client and what can that offer me?</h3>
<p>In addition to smoother payment options via invoicing once every two weeks rather than for every delivery, Hushpuppy Courier can also negotiate discounted delivery fees and more automated communication options for clients making regular use of our service. Becoming a regular client is ideal for restaurants and other local companies wanting to deliver through Hushpuppy Courier, venues and promotion companies wanting to do regular event flyering, local publications wanting scheduled delivery routes, and any other people and businesses who would like to use Hushpuppy Courier more than twice a week.
