  venues and promotion companies wanting to do regular event flyering, local publications wanting scheduled delivery routes, and any other
  individuals and businesses who would like regular errand services.

            <br>
<p>Cycling an incredibly efficient way to deliver stuff within most urban and suburban areas. 
  To quote <a href ="http://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/why-i-bike">Bill Nye</a>: “There is no machine known that is more efficient than a human on a bicycle. A bowl of oatmeal, 
  30 miles, you can’t come close to that.” 
  Bikes require no fossil fuels to run and far less fossil fuels to manufacture and maintain than automobiles. 
  They also take up far less space on the road than automobiles, cutting down on traffic and parking problems.
  Sure, bikes cannot transport absolutely everything required by the daily life of modern society, 
  but you may be pleasantly surprised by how much a professional bicycle messenger from Hushpuppy Courier can do for you
  in a growing city like Gainesville.

                      <br>
<p>We have years of experience riding safely and efficiently in all weather and traffic conditions,
  and we've got the right gear to deliver your stuff properly. Between
  75L waterproof messenger backpacks, Front racks rated for 60lbs, 
  and insulated warming bags, we've got you covered. Also, we'll never hit the road without a helmet, bell, lights, and flat-change kit.
  We only take a job if we’re positive we can complete it to your total satisifcation, 
  and if we think your delivery requires any extra packaging, we can advise you on how best to prepare it. 
  Most things packaged to travel by car will also travel just fine by bike. 
  That being said, we currently won't deliver drink orders not in bottles or cans, and we may also turn down cupcakes or other especially fragile food orders depending on packaging and distance.
